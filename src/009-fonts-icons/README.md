### To Do
 
- [Watch this video with the design][7]

- Run the base project.

```sh
$ npm install http-server -g
$ cd u-css/
$ http-server ./src -p 3000
```

- Continue the Z Index, !important and Inheritance exercise in which we are going to change some labels using Fonts, Icons and Sizes.

1. Change the Inheritance font for raleway thin with, verdana, arial, sans-serif.
2. The first letter in all the simple text should be bold.
3. Remove the second test in the blue container and create an input with a find in page icon ([Material][6]).
4. Add 3 icons to the right between the title and the first text ([Font Awesome][5]).
4. Remove the third test in the white container and create a button with fingerprint icon ([Material][6]).
5. On the yellow container the pair items should use ‘pt’ and have a text after saying “using ‘pt’ “ 
6. On the yellow container the odd items except the first one should be raleway normal, use ‘em’ and have a text after saying “using ‘em’ ”.
