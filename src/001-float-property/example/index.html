              <h2>The Puppys</h2>
              <img src="img/dog1.jpg" alt="pretty-doggy" class="img-wp">
              <p>A puppy is a juvenile dog. Some puppies can weigh 1–3 lb (0.45–1.36 kg), while larger ones can weigh up to 15–23 lb (6.8–10.4 kg). 
                All healthy puppies grow quickly after birth. A puppy's coat color may change as the puppy grows older, as is commonly seen in breeds such as the Yorkshire Terrier. 
                In vernacular English, puppy refers specifically to dogs, while pup may often be used for other mammals such as seals, giraffes, guinea pigs, or even rats.
                Puppies are highly social animals and spend most of their waking hours interacting with either their mother or littermates. 
                When puppies are socialized with humans, particularly between the ages of eight and twelve weeks, they develop social skills around people. 
                Those that do not receive adequate socialization during this period may display fearful behavior around humans or other dogs as adults.
                The optimum period for socialisation is between eight and twelve weeks; professional animal trainers and the American Kennel Club advise puppies should be introduced to "100 People by 12 Weeks" and have encountered a wide and varied selection of people and environments
                At first, puppies spend the large majority of their time sleeping and the rest feeding. They instinctively pile together into a heap, and become distressed if separated from physical contact with their littermates, by even a short distance.</p>

              <h2>Renaissance</h2>
              <p>The intellectual basis of the Renaissance was its own invented version of humanism, derived from the rediscovery of classical Greek philosophy, 
              such as that of Protagoras, who said that "Man is the measure of all things." This new thinking became manifest in art, architecture, politics, science and literature. 
              Early examples were the development of perspective in oil painting and the recycled knowledge of how to make concrete. 
              Although the invention of metal movable type sped the dissemination of ideas from the later 15th century, the changes of the Renaissance were not uniformly experienced across Europe.
              As a cultural movement, the Renaissance encompassed innovative flowering of Latin and vernacular literatures, 
              beginning with the 14th-century resurgence of learning based on classical sources, which contemporaries credited to Petrarch; 
              the development of linear perspective and other techniques of rendering a more natural reality in painting; and gradual but widespread educational reform. 
              In politics, the Renaissance contributed to the development of the customs and conventions of diplomacy, and in science to an increased reliance on observation and inductive reasoning. 
              Although the Renaissance saw revolutions in many intellectual pursuits, as well as social and political upheaval, 
              it is perhaps best known for its artistic developments and the contributions of such polymaths as Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo, who inspired the term "Renaissance man".</p>
